#Attempts to isolate the build system from the host distribution's C library in
#order to make re-use of native shared state artifacts across different host
#distributions practical. With this class enabled, a tarball containing a
#pre-built C library is downloaded at the start of the build. In the Poky reference
#distribution this is enabled by default through
#meta/conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc. Other distributions that do not
#derive from poky can also "require conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc" to use this.
#Alternatively if you prefer, you can build the uninative-tarball recipe yourself, publish
#the resulting tarball (e.g. via HTTP) and set UNINATIVE_URL and UNINATIVE_CHECKSUM appropriately.
#For an example, see the meta/conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc.

#The uninative class is also used unconditionally by the extensible SDK.
#When building the extensible SDK, uninative-tarball is built and the resulting
#tarball is included within the SDK.

# QA check settings - a little stricter than the OE-Core defaults
